# UBC Events & Opportunities Hub

## Overview

Students at UBC often struggle to find relevant events and opportunities that are clearly and reliably available. Event information is scattered across websites, Instagram pages, email newsletters, and physical posters, making it easy to miss deadlines or overlook valuable opportunities.

This project aims to solve that problem by creating a centralized platform that consolidates UBC events into one organized, easy-to-use, and personalized hub. Instead of hunting across multiple platforms, students can discover opportunities in one place, presented in a clean and consistent format.

## Features

- Centralized event listings for UBC-related opportunities  
- Clean and consistent user interface  
- Personalized recommendations based on:
  - Faculty
  - Experience level
  - Interests (e.g. AI, sustainability, design, business, social impact, and more)
- Simplified discovery of events, deadlines, and involvement opportunities

Our mission is to help students get involved in the UBC community, grow their skills, and build their resumes without stress or confusion.
